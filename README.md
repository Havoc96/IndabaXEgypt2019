**IndabaXEgypt 2019**

A Deep Learning Indaba𝕏 is a locally-organised meeting that helps spread knowledge and build capacity in machine learning.

In 2019, the IndabaX reached Egypt! Completing a continuous stream of events crossing the continent from the cape up to the Mediterranean. 

In May 2019, we hosted a two day event with talks, tutorials and a poster competition where the community discussed and learnt about different fields in machine learning, came together and enjoyed a rewarding experience.
